# seasonal-form

This is a small personal front-end project.

It was created for a seasonal purpose,
used briefly, and then left alone on purpose.

If you are opening this again:
- Yes, this is the repo you are looking for
- No, it is not broken
- And no, it does not contain the backend

---

## What’s here

- Static front-end files only
- Talks to external services (not included here)
- Nothing sensitive is stored in this repository

---

## How to open it locally

Any simple static server works.

On Windows, you previously used:

```bash
start-server.bat
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

If something feels off

Before touching anything,
read _note.md.

Seriously.
